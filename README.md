## Hi there, I'm Leonardo! 👋

I am an M.Sc. Computer Engineering student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics** at the **Polytechnic of Turin**.

My passion lies at the intersection of **Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Generative AI**. I am driven by the challenge of taking theoretical AI models and applying them to solve complex, real-world problems.

## 💻 Previous Projects
- **[AI Tutor Platform (Bachelor Thesis)](https://github.com/leo54200/AI-Powered-Study-Group-Website):** Designed a web application utilizing **OpenAI's LLMs** to create interactive virtual avatars that guide high school students in collaborative study sessions.
- **[Generative Experience Replay for RL](https://github.com/alicebanaudi/Experience-Replay-for-Action-Generalization-and-Multi-Agent-System):** Studied a diffusion-based replay buffer to improve sample efficiency in Multi-Agent RL (SUMO & Overcooked environments).
- **[Photomosaic Generation with SDXL](https://github.com/m4rk-git/Visual-Generation-Contest):** A generative photomosaic creator powered by Stable Diffusion XL and color quantization, assembling large images from semantic micro-tiles.
- **[Bare-Metal Pac-Man for ARM Cortex-M3](https://github.com/leo54200/Pac-Man-Game-for-ARM-on-LandTiger-1768):** Programmed a hardware-integrated game in C and ARM Assembly, demonstrating the low-level system architecture and memory management skills essential for Edge AI computing.
